//! Thread-safe collection types backed by levelDB.
//!
//! In particular:
//!  - [`storage_vec::RustyLevelDbVec`] provides a database-backed Vec with
//!    read/write cache and atomic writes.
//!  - [`storage_schema::SimpleRustyStorage`] provides atomic DB writes across
//!    any number of `DbtVec` or `DbtSingleton` "tables"
//!  - [`database_array::DatabaseArray`] and [`database_vector::DatabaseVector`] provide uncached
//!    and non-atomic writes.
//!  - [`level_db::DB`] provides direct access to the LevelDB API.

// For anyone reading this code and trying to understand the StorageVec trait and the DbSchema
// in particular, especially with regards to locks, mutability, and concurrency, the following
// may help speed understanding.  This explains the "Why" of present design.
//
//  0. DbtSchema::tables holds an Arc::clone() reference to each instance of a `DbTable`
//     implementor such as DbtVec.  This is done so that DbtSchema can iterate over these
//     tables, collect pending Write operations into a database WriteBatch, then send
//     all writes to DB at once, atomically.
//  1. To have a reference in DbtSchema::tables, a `DBTable` implementor such as DbtVec
//     must include Arc, to impl cheap reference clone.
//  2. For mutability of its contents, Arc must include either RwLock or Mutex.
//  3. Without Arc<Mutex<..>> wrapper around DbtVecPrivate, DbtVec cannot modify
//     anything, unless it's methods are &mut self.
//  4. StorageVec methods are presently &self, not &mut self.
//  5. StorageVec methods are &self because that allows eg DbtVec to be shared between
//     threads directly.  Rust does not allow mutable method calls on an item that
//     is shared between threads.
//  6. An alternative could be to make StorageVec methods take &mut self, remove Arc<RwLock<..>>
//     from within DbtVec, and then wrap DbtVec with Arc<Mutex<..>> and clone before returning
//     from `DbtSchema::new_vec()`.  This requires callers to see and deal with locks, rather than
//     keeping them encapsulated inside DbtVec.
//  7. For multi-table read/write atomicity, it is also necessary to have locks over all related
//     `dyn DbTable` items created by `DbtSchema`. Given this, the locks over individual tables,
//     such as DbtVec are redundant, and it would be desirable to eliminate them.  However, then
//     refer back to point 1 above.  If we wish to continue with this DbtSchema model of references,
//     the individual tables must have locks around them, somehow.
//  8. So with these points in mind, we have settled on the present design/impl, for now.
//  9. An alternative design might get rid of the DbtSchema::tables entirely and just create a
//     collection/struct of `dyn DbTable` types.  There would be a lock around the collection
//     but no inner lock for each table, and no Arc reference for each.  When it is time to write
//     to database, the collection would be iterated to obtain the Write operations, instead of
//     iterating over DbtSchema::tables.  The primary advantage here is getting rid of the inner
//     locks, which may not be any performance issue anyway, as there is only one lock acquisition
//     per operation.  The disadvantage is that caller must keep track of the created tables
//     and pass them to StorageWriter::persist() as Vec<&type as &dyn DbTable>, which is ugly.
